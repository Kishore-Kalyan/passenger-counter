# Passenger Counter

This is a simple static website that allows you to count the number of passengers using an increment button and save the entries using a save button. It has been built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and uses the Poppins font from Google Fonts.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will be presented with a counter that starts at 0. To increment the counter, simply click on the "increment" button. You can continue to do this as many times as you like to count the number of passengers.

Once you are done counting, you can save the number of passengers by clicking on the "Save" button. This will save the current count to your local storage.

## Features
- Simple and easy-to-use interface
- Uses the Poppins font from Google Fonts for a clean and modern look
- Uses local storage to save the number of passengers for later use
